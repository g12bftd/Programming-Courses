# Programming-Courses

A few programming courses I undertook on my data science journey.

### 1) Python A-Z: Python for Data Science with Real-World Exercises
Programming In Python For Data Analytics And Data Science. Learn Statistical Analysis, Data Mining And Visualization


### 2) Machine Learning A-Z: Hands-on Python & R in Data Science
A course on implementing common machine learning algorithms in the fields of :
- Regression
- Classification
- Clustering
- Dimensionality Reduction
- Deep Learning
etc...

Programming challenges are completed in both Python and R wherever possible.

### 3) Deep Learning A-Z: Hands-on Artifical Neural Networks

An introductory course on implementing deep learning algorithms using Python. 
Practical projects include:
- Using self-organizing maps to detect fraudulent online transactions
- Using recurrent neural networks to predict Google's stock price
- Using autoencoders in the context of movie reviews & sentiment analysis
